This website was created by a\n                          team of three developers. We took a very collaborative approach and performed most work\n                          while together on a zoom call. We frequently did mob and pair programming on issues that\n                          cropped up and were always clear with each other about what we were working on. My role in\n                          the project was primarily visual and included making the website as mobile-friendly as possible.\n                          I also was responsible for doing the initial Stripe setup and helped with paired programming\n                          on most other aspects of the site. Additionally, I organized the Sprint Plan and held informal\n                          check-ins daily to assess where we were in the project according to our goals.\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          ELM PRINTS was made using React with TypeScript with Material-UI & Sass for the front-end with\n                          Node, Express and MongoDB with Mongoose for the back-end. We utilized Stripe to handle\n                          purchases and JSON Web Tokens for authentication/authorization.\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          This was an incredibly rewarding project.

This was my first\n                          large-scale browser project and was incredibly exciting for me to develop. From the\n                          very beginning, the conception of the game grabbed me and drove me forward to write\n                          thousands of lines of code within the week timeframe my class had for this project.\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          UNITY tells the story of a zero-dimensional being, Sisyphus, who is pulled from his\n                          zero-dimensional space by a mysterious being. Unable to cope with his expanded reality,\n                          he seeks to reduce everything into zero-dimensional space. The battle mechanics are\n                          similar to Pokemon which inspired the battle screen's layout as well. The game was\n                          made with a grayscale color palette, and it has a title screen, main menu with \n                          options & instructions menus, opening and closing stories, a level-up screen, a credit screen, and two \n                          enemy battles. After winning the game, you unlock Infinite Mode as well which allows\n                          a player to battle enemies at random indefinitely. And like any good video game, there's sound!\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          This project was an absolute blast for me. I loved working on the battle animations \n                          and feel like I created something I am really proud of. Because I made this project\n                          with vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS, I feel that this project highly strengthened\n                          those fundamentals.\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          <strong>Deployed website link: <a href=\"https://petefitton.github.io/UNITY/\" target=\"_blank\">https://petefitton.github.io/UNITY/</a></strong>\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          <strong>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/petefitton/UNITY\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/petefitton/UNITY</a></strong>\n                          </p>\n                        </header>\n                      </article>\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"col-12 col-12-mobile\">\n                      <article className=\"item\" id=\"guitstrum\">\n                        <h2>GuitStrum</h2>\n                        {/* <a href=\"/#\" className=\"image fit\">\n                          <img src={pic6} alt=\"\" />\n                          <img src={pic62} alt=\"\" />\n                          <img src={pic63} alt=\"\" />\n                        </a> */}\n                        <video width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" controls loop>\n                          <source src={guitstrumVideo} type=\"video/mp4\"></source>\n                        Your browser does not support the video tag.\n                        </video>\n                        <header>\n                          <p style={{\"font-size\": \"1.25em\", \"padding-left\": \"40px\", \"padding-right\": \"40px\"}}><strong>GuitStrum</strong> is \n                          a website built for beginner/intermediate guitarists. It consists of two main parts: \n                          a section of the website for exploring/learning Chords and another section for writing\n                          and viewing other user's songs (chord progressions).\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          The site was made using Node, Express, PostGreSQL, Axios, EJS, RegEx, Materialize with jQuery & CSS, and HTML.\n                          I worked with a UX Designer in the early stages to review my wireframes and improve\n                          the user experience of the site. My early conversations with the UX Designer were \n                          very helpful and really got me thinking about the user experience of the site in a critical\n                          way. These conversations still influence my approach to website design and improving the\n                          usability of my products.\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          This site was a real challenge at a couple points: searching for and rendering chords\n                          required doing a mixture of Axios calls with pulling the images directly from a URL\n                          that created the chord images. Handling the various ways in which the chords were named/\n                          the syntax used in their names was also a bit challenging at times. The song rendering\n                          both for the forms for creating songs and displaying created songs was not as difficult\n                          as I had anticipated; however, I was only able to offer simple settings as integrating \n                          more complexity would have taken more time. I definitely realized coming out of the project\n                          that this idea is probably better suited to a stand-alone application more than a web app.\n                          I still had a great time and learned a lot though!\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          <strong>Deployed website link: <a href=\"https://guitstrum.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://guitstrum.herokuapp.com/</a></strong>\n                          <br />\n                          <br />\n                          <strong>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/petefitton/GuitStrum\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/petefitton/GuitStrum</a></strong>\n                          </p>\n                        </header>\n                      </article>\n                    </div>\n                  </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <section id=\"about\" className=\"three\">\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <header>\n            <h2>About Me</h2>\n          </header>\n\n          <a href=\"/#\" className=\"image featured\">\n            <img src={pic8} alt=\"\" />\n          </a>\n\n          <p style={{\"margin\": \"20px\"}}>\n            I was born in the small town of Harrison, Arkansas. \n            I have gone on to live in New Mexico, Vermont, Berlin (Germany), and Seattle. \n            I love traveling and have been an active musician since I was four years old \n            and performed in my first musical.
